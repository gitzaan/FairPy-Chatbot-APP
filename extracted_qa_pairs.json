For best delivery please send your flight details so we can monitor the flight status & park the car accordingly I have two options for delivery/drop off. Option 1: Delivery : I will Park near the terminal you arrive . Will send you clear pictures/videos of where I parked. Once you get to the car you can send me a selfie with the car and your drivers license . I will remote unlock the car for you. There is a toll charge for parking at the airport. The toll charges will be anywhere between $2-$10. Drop off: You will park near the terminal of departure & you will send me a picture of where you parked with the Row & Level. I will remote lock the car once you send me the picture. Make sure you dont park in 1 or 2 hour parking spots. There is a toll charge for parking at the airport. The toll charges will be anywhere between $2-$10. Option 2: Delivery: I will Park at rental car drive. You can take any rental car shuttle from your airport terminal to get to the rental car drive. Will send you clear pictures/videos of where I parked. Once you reach the car you will send me a selfie of yourself with the car & a copy of your drivers license. I will remote unlock the car once you send me that. No tolls here. Drop off: You will park in the rental car drive in 2 hour parking spots preferably closer to where you picked up the car from. Make sure you don't park in airport parking spots. You will send me a picture of where you parked. I will remote lock the car once you send me the picture. Please note additional parking charges may apply and I only charge for whatever I am being charged by the airport parking. You will be charged for tolls/parking only after the end of your trip along with any other tolls you take during your trip. If there is a toll ticket in the car you will use that if you dont see a toll ticket then the car will have a toll transponder so you dont need pay at the toll, I will charge you post trip. Let me know which option works best for you",

Here are the options: Option 1: We'll park near your arrival terminal, and I'll send you the location. Once you arrive, take a selfie with the car and your driver's license, and I'll remotely unlock the car for you. For drop-off, park near the departure terminal, take a photo of the location, and I'll lock the car remotely. Please note that airport parking charges ($2-$10) will apply for both drop-off and pickup. Option 2: We'll park at the rental car center. You can take any rental car shuttle from the terminal to reach the car. Upon arrival, take a selfie with the car and your driver's license, and I'll remotely unlock the car. For drop-off, park in one of the 2 hour spots in the rental car drive, take a photo, and I'll lock the car remotely. There are no tolls associated with this option. Option 3: I'll pick you up right outside your gate of arrival and drop myself at the airport car rental center. You can then check-in there. For drop-off, park near the departure terminal, take a photo of the location, and I'll lock the car remotely. In case of flight delay or baggage delay, you'll be automatically switched to Option 1, unless you specifically request for Option 2. Please note that airport toll/parking charges ($2-$10) will apply for both drop-off and pickup. Please note I only charge for tolls/parking based on your usage I don't add commission/fee it it. And you will be charged post trip. The car has a toll transponder, so you won't need to pay for tolls at the toll booths. Let me know your preferred option.",

Here are the options: Option 1: We'll park near your arrival terminal, and I'll send you the location. Once you arrive, take a selfie with the car and your driver's license, and I'll remotely unlock the car for you. For drop-off, park near the departure terminal, take a photo of the location, and I'll lock the car remotely. Please note that airport parking charges ($2-$10) will apply for both drop-off and pickup. Option 2: We'll park at the rental car center. You can take any rental car shuttle from the terminal to reach the car. Upon arrival, take a selfie with the car and your driver's license, and I'll remotely unlock the car. For drop-off, park in one of the 2 hour spots in the rental car drive, take a photo, and I'll lock the car remotely. There are no tolls associated with this option. Option 3: I'll pick you up right outside your gate of arrival and drop myself at the airport car rental center. You can then check-in there. For drop-off, park near the departure terminal, take a photo of the location, and I'll lock the car remotely. In case of flight delay or baggage delay, you'll be automatically switched to Option 1, unless you specifically request for Option 2. Please note that airport toll/parking charges ($2-$10) will apply for both drop-off and pickup. Please note I only charge for tolls/parking based on your usage I don't add commission/fee it it. And you will be charged post trip. The car has a toll transponder, so you won't need to pay for tolls at the toll booths. Let me know your preferred option.",

To drop off the vehicle, the process is similar to the pickup. You drop the car off in the parking spot closest to your departure gate and send us a few pictures of the parking spot. We especially need to know the terminal, level and row of the parking spot. Please don't forget to send us the pictures of the parking spot. To lock the car using Turo GO, check your belongings, check the windows, leave the key in the glovebox and then proceed to lock the car within the Turo app. IF THE TURO GO DOESN'T WORK, YOU CAN LEAVE THE CAR UNLOCKED WITH THE KEY IN THE GLOVEBOX AND LET US KNOW. For any information on refueling, tolls or drop off, you can also refer to our FAQ section. Thank you for choosing to rent with us!",

For drop-off, park near the departure terminal, take a photo of the location, and I'll lock the car remotely.

For drop-off, park in one of the 2 hour spots in the rental car drive, take a photo, and I'll lock the car remotely. There are no tolls associated with this option. Option 3: I'll pick you up right outside your gate of arrival and drop myself at the airport car rental center. You can then check-in there. For drop-off, park near the departure terminal, take a photo of the location, and I'll lock the car remotely. In case of flight delay or baggage delay, you'll be automatically switched to Option 1, unless you specifically request for Option 2.

We will be available to guide you over the phone as well if you face any trouble locating the vehicle. We will also send you the video walk-through of how to unlock the lockbox that contains the key.

We especially need to know the terminal, level and row of the parking spot. Please don't forget to send us the pictures of the parking spot. To lock the car, check your belongings, roll the driver side window down half way to hang the lockbox on the window and then roll it back up, lock the car and put the key in the lockbox and lock it using the code we texted to you. Feel free to text us for the code if you can't find it. Thank you for choosing to rent with Fairpy!",

We especially need to know the terminal, level and row of the parking spot. Please don't forget to send us the pictures of the parking spot. To lock the car, check your belongings, roll the driver side window down half way to hang the lockbox on the window and then roll it back up, lock the car and put the key in the lockbox and lock it using the code we texted to you. Feel free to text us for the code if you can't find it. Thank you for choosing to rent with Fairpy! Hi Kim let me know what time you will be dropping off the car.

We try to park the car closest to that gate so you can reach your car conveniently and hassle-free. So in your case, you will probably come out of C16 terminal C. We will try to park the car right across from you and just before you land we will send you a video-walkthrough of where exactly to find and unlock the car.",

We would need your flight information to look up what gate you will be arriving to. Also, before you start your trip, we require a Driver's License or State ID to check you in. The way it works is, the DFW airport has 5 terminals. Each terminal has a parking garage right across. We need your flight information to look up what terminal/gate you will be arriving at. We try to park the car closest to that gate so you can reach your car conveniently and hassle-free. Just before you land. we will send you a video walkthrough of where exactly to find and unlock the car. Once you locate the car, to unlock it you use the code that we provide you with to unlock the lockbox on the window of the car. You punch the code in and twist the know to the right to retrieve the key. Please note - All our cars have a strict no-smoking policy enforced. Thank you for choosing to rent with us.",

    "question": "How do you unlock form app ? From * We are here at the car Thank you We are inside the car",
    "answer": "Hi ELISA! Hope you had a great experience renting with us! Please let us know at what time you have planned to get to the airport to drop the car off. To drop off the vehicle, the process is similar to the pickup. You drop the car off in the parking spot closest to your departure gate and send us a few pictures of the parking spot. We especially need to know the terminal, level and row of the parking spot. Please don't forget to send us the pictures of the parking spot. To lock the car using Turo GO, check your belongings, check the windows, leave the key in the glovebox and then proceed to lock the car within the Turo app. IF THE TURO GO DOESN'T WORK, YOU CAN LEAVE THE CAR UNLOCKED WITH THE KEY IN THE GLOVEBOX AND LET US KNOW. For any information on refueling, tolls or drop off, you can also refer to our FAQ section. Thank you for choosing to rent with us!",

We try to park the car closest to that gate so you can reach your car conveniently and hassle-free. Just before you land. we will send you a video walkthrough of where exactly to find and unlock the car. Once you locate the car, to unlock it you use the code that we provide you with to unlock the lockbox on the window of the car. You punch the code in and twist the knob to the right to retrieve the key. Please note - All our cars have a strict no-smoking policy enforced. If you have any questions regarding the drop off, refueling, using tolls etc.. you can check out the FAQ section for answers to these questions. Thank you for choosing to rent with us.",

To lock the car, check your belongings, roll the driver side window down half way to hang the lockbox on the window and then roll it back up, lock the car and put the key in the lockbox and lock it using the code we texted to you. Feel free to text us for the code if you can't find it. Thank you for choosing to rent with us!",

To lock the car using Turo GO, check your belongings, check the windows, leave the key in the glovebox and then proceed to lock the car within the Turo app. IF THE TURO GO DOESN'T WORK, YOU CAN LEAVE THE CAR UNLOCKED WITH THE KEY IN THE GLOVEBOX AND LET US KNOW. For any information on refueling, tolls or drop off, you can also refer to our FAQ section. Thank you for choosing to rent with us!",

We especially need to know the terminal, level and row of the parking spot. Please don't forget to send us the pictures of the parking spot. To lock the car, check your belongings, roll the driver side window down half way to hang the lockbox on the window and then roll it back up, lock the car and put the key in the lockbox and lock it using the code we texted to you. Feel free to text us for the code if you can't find it. Thank you for choosing to rent with us!",

As the host do you believe this is a win win resolve? I'm being charged for $20.00 extra for gas! I think it's unfair and not the best outcome to resolve this disagreement. I would understand if it was way below the acceptable limit and you asked for fuel expenses. I do take it personal as money is the only motivation here. A very disappointing experience for me…..",

Would that be possible? I'm hoping to return it back to the airport on 11/27 between 4 and 5PM as my flight leaves around half past 6PM. Looking forward to connecting. Cheers, Joshua",
    "answer": "Hi Joshua! Welcome to Dallas! We try to provide our services as hassle-free as possible. Please read the instructions on how to start your trip with us. We would need your flight information to look up what gate you will be arriving to. Also, before you start your trip, we require a Driver's License or State ID to check you in. The way it works is, the DFW airport has 5 terminals. Each terminal has a parking garage right across. We need your flight information to look up what terminal/gate you will be arriving at. We try to park the car closest to that gate so you can reach your car conveniently and hassle-free. Just before you land. we will send you a video walkthrough of where exactly to find and unlock the car. Once you locate the car, to unlock it you use the code that we provide you with to unlock the lockbox on the window of the car. You punch the code in and twist the knob to the right to retrieve the key. Please note - All our cars have a strict no-smoking policy enforced. If you have any questions regarding the drop off, refueling, using tolls etc.. you can check out the FAQ section for answers to these questions. Thank you for choosing to rent with us.",

I think you should contact turo assistance Hi, This is your turo co-host. How are you doing today. Instructions Ahead : After you exit the gate A10 cross through the walk zone to the parking garage and take elevators to level 4. I have also taken some pictures to help you. You can find them below attached. The vehicle is at Level 4 gate A8, and the key is in the glove box. Once you reach near the vehicle, let us know that you have access. If you're lost or need any help, please feel free to contact me. Also, there is a toll sticker on the windshield that you can use when you're getting exited from the airport on the toll lane and on the highway, too. After the trip is finished, we will figure out the invoice and send you a message for toll charge. While ending the trip, you can leave the vehicle in the same manner as received. Thank you, Have a safe trip. The car is in front of the elevators at level 4. Hi Tatiana! Hope you had a great experience renting with us! Please let us know at what time you have planned to get to the airport to drop the car off. To drop off the vehicle, the process is similar to the pickup. You drop the car off in the parking spot closest to your departure gate and send us a few pictures of the parking spot. We especially need to know the terminal, level and row of the parking spot. Please don't forget to send us the pictures of the parking spot. To lock the car using Turo GO, check your belongings, check the windows, leave the key in the glovebox and then proceed to lock the car within the Turo app. IF THE TURO GO DOESN'T WORK, YOU CAN LEAVE THE CAR UNLOCKED WITH THE KEY IN THE GLOVEBOX AND LET US KNOW. For any information on refueling, tolls or drop off, you can also refer to our FAQ section. Thank you for choosing to rent with us!",
